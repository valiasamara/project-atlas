This woman was known to be colonized by group A beta- hemolytic streptococcus (strepococcus pyogenes). Approximately 8 hours following an uneventful delivery, she began to complain of back and pelvic pain. Within 4 hours she was in full-blown shock and was refractory to resuscitative measures. Death was pronounced approximately 14 hours following her delivery. Figure (a) depicts the gravid uterus and confluent brown-black discoloration of the left adnexa, which proved microscopically to show areas of necrosis with numerous clusters of bacterial cocci and scant neutrophilic infiltrates. Postmortem cultures of multiple organs, including lungs, liver, spleen, uterus, and peritoneal fluid, all grew group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus betahemolitic streptococcus. This “toxic shock like” death due to group A streptococcus has given rise to the term “flesh-eating bacteria.”"

C:\Users\valak\Desktop\thesis\images\page_95_image_1.png,"This case involved an elderly woman with a history of dementia who could no longer live independently and was made a ward of the state. She was hospitalized for long-term intermediate care. She had undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion due to insufficient oral intake (a). She underwent a tube replacement for leakage. Later that evening, she experienced acute onset of abdominal pain that was complicated by increasing abdominal distension, green discoloration of the abdominal wall site, and purulent drainage from the tube site. The remainder of her course was characterized by respiratory distress, aspiration of gastric contents, hypotension, and tachypnea, culminating in systemic inflammatory response syndrome with lactic acidosis, multisystem organ failure, and hemodynamic instability, refractory to aggressive resuscitative measures. Autopsy revealed intraperitoneal placement of the gastrostomy tube with intraperitoneal administration of enteral feedings and a collection of approximately 700 mL of turbid peritoneal fluid with extensive fibrinous adhesions. Microscopic examination confirmed an exuberant fibrinous exudate with scattered clusters of bacterial cocci and yeast, as well as birefringent material. The cause of death was certified as complications of peritonitis following intraperitoneal placement of gastrostomy tube during tube change, following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion for insufficient oral intake related to atherosclerotic cerebral vascular disease and dementia.

This 7-month-old female infant was found unresponsive in a car seat that fell off of an adult bed, with her chin tightly opposed to her chest, satisfying the criteria for positional asphyxia. She survived for several days and was ultimately declared brain dead. No other injuries were identified upon autopsy examination. This was the body of a completely healthy female infant. Her mother, who had left her unattended for an unknown period of time with her 18-month- old brother, found her submerged in a bathtub. The mother reportedly left them both in the tub without water and claimed the brother had to have turned on the faucets. When police attempted to reconstruct the scene, the older brother was unable to turn the faucets. Although the cause of death in this case was certified as drowning and the manner homicide, the mother was released on probation. This 9-month-old child with a history of asthma was found unresponsive in her crib. Autopsy demonstrated multiple mucous plugs within the medium-sized airways, along with well-defined pathologic features of chronic asthma. No injuries were found. Death was certified as complications of bronchial asthma. Although unusual in a child this young, asthma can indeed be fatal. These bilateral vertical incisions made at the time of autopsy failed to demonstrate contusions."

Maternal history was significant only for group B streptococcal infection. This picture depicts prominent petechiae on the anterior capsular surface of the thymus. Petechiae involving the thymic, visceral pleural, and epicardial surfaces are extremely common findings in sudden infant deaths, including deaths that have been ascribed to SIDS (up to ~85 % of SIDS fatalities). The precise mechanism underlying the formation of petechiae remains elusive, but is believed to be related to the negative pressure created by terminal gasping in infants. However, it is well known that these petechiae are not in any way specific or pathognomonic for SIDS and may be found in deaths due to many other causes, including definable natural disease conditions, accidental injuries, and inflicted injuries (homicides). In this case, the petechiae, which appear as pinpoint hemorrhages, are particularly striking. This is a view of the thoracic contents of an infant who was found unresponsive while sharing a bed with his mother while in a supine position. She called 911 and paramedics arrived to find him apneic and pulseless. He could not be resuscitated. Pertinent history included prematurity, maternal group B streptococcal infection, and a recent upper respiratory infection. The only significant findings at autopsy were a moderately cellular mononuclear leptomeningeal exudate consistent with a viral meningoencephalitis. However, there was no significant brain swelling. This fatality occurred in the early to mid-1990s, and the death was ascribed to SIDS.

She had finished a course of amoxicillin for otitis media 3 days prior to her death. On the day before her death, she apparently fell off a “teeter-totter” and struck her head on the ground, which was a muddy, grassy surface, but she never lost consciousness and experienced no mental status changes.

Poor skin elasticity (turgor) is demonstrated in these infants who were refrigerated in the morgue overnight. These infants were shown not to be dehydrated by vitreous analyte determination and antemortem hospital chemistry testing. The poor skin elasticity in these cases is due to the congealing of fat as a result of postmortem refrigeration.

The grandfather’s apartment was not made “child-safe” prior to the visit. The toddler was standing and rocking a large old wooden television back and forth on a stand that was missing several screws. The television toppled over and crushed the child’s head. Note the fracture pattern to the skull indicating a crush-type injury. Also note the photograph demonstrating the top of the skull reflected with underlying dura mater still overlying the brain with epidural hemorrhage.

C:\Users\valak\Desktop\thesis\images\page_292_image_1.png,This approximately 30-year-old woman was found naked from the waist down in a construction yard. She had moderate decompositional changes with insect and animal feeding. She had multiple defects to her scalp and face with numerous maggots tracking through the underlying soft tissue. The soft tissues in this region were darkly discolored throughout. It becomes more difficult to interpret soft-tissue injuries as decomposition progresses. Careful examination of the underlying bone in such cases may often yield valuable information. Note the approximately 1/4” linear skull fracture with a 1/16” roughly square indentation at the superior right temporal bone. Further examination of the scene revealed a bloodstained board with a nail at the opposite side of the construction site.

C:\Users\valak\Desktop\thesis\images\page_309_image_1.png,(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Entrance gunshot wound with surrounding stippling defects indicating intermediate range of fire. This gunshot wound (a) to the thick skin of the palm of the hand reveals typical small radiating lacerations without prominent margin of abrasion. These characteristics are typical for gunshot wounds of the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. These images (b–e) represent the same contact gunshot wound with varying degrees of tension surrounding the wound’s surface. Note that with approximation of the margins (d–e) the wound forms a roughly circular perforation with margin of abrasion typical of an entrance gunshot wound. Also note the copious amounts of soot within the wound track and at the underlying bone surface. Such large radiating linear lacerations are usually associated with higher- caliber guns and tight contact of the gun muzzle on the body surface with underlying bone close to the skin. The expanding gases from burning gunpowder forced into the wound track causes such lacerations.

Note the fractures of this hyoid bone with vague hemorrhages in a decedent with slight to moderate decomposition. Fractures of the hyoid bone are often found in association with homicidal strangulation. The presence of a hyoid bone fracture does not indicate that the case must be a strangulation and the absence of fractures to the hyoid bone does not indicate the decedent was not strangled. Fractures can occur as a result of a blunt impact as well. Strangulation. Posterior neck dissection with hemorrhage to the superior aspect of the semispinalis capitis muscle.
